# spatial-kfold
spatial resampling for more robust cross validation in spatial studies

spatial-kfold is a python library for performing spatial resampling to ensure more robust cross-validation in spatial studies. It offers spatial clustering and block resampling technique with  user-friendly parameters to customize the resampling. It enables users to conduct a "Leave Region Out" cross-validation, which can be useful for evaluating the model's generalization to new locations as well as improving the reliability of [feature selection](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108815) and [hyperparameter tuning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.06.002) in spatial studies
